      "Dataset Overview:\n",
      "- This dataset contains information about parks and their zones, providing details on their size in acres, borough, community board, council district, department, and a descriptive location. It includes identifiers such as GIS property number, precinct, and OMP property ID, along with state assembly and senate district information, and zip codes. The dataset's spatial role is boundary, with a multi-level geometry type that supports area-based aggregation and administrative-region analysis. The multipolygon column defines the geographical boundaries for each park zone. This data is useful for analyzing parkland distribution across different administrative divisions, planning park maintenance and development based on area and location, and understanding the spatial extent of recreational zones within parks.\n",

      "Additional Context:\n",
      "- This dataset is crucial for understanding the spatial distribution and administrative context of urban parkland. It supports interdisciplinary research combining urban planning, environmental science, and public policy by providing detailed geographic information linked to governmental administrative structures. Its granular data on park zones allows for precise analysis of green infrastructure, accessibility, and resource management within different municipal divisions. The dataset can be integrated with other urban datasets (e.g., population density, socio-economic indicators) to conduct comprehensive analyses of urban environments and community well-being.\n",
